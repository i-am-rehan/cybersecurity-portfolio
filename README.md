## 📂 Projects
- **[🛡️ Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/internal-security-audit-botium-toys)**  
  NIST CSF-based audit for a fictional toy company. Included risk assessment, compliance checklist, and self-assessment.

- **[🚨 SYN Flood Case Study – Network Attack Analysis](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Analyze-network-attacks)**  
  Investigated a SYN flood DoS attack using Wireshark. Differentiated between normal and malicious TCP traffic and wrote a professional incident report.  
  Files include log analysis, report, and interpretation guide.

- **[🔐 Brute Force Attack Case Study – HTTP & DNS Log Analysis](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/security-incident-report-brute-force)**  
  Investigated a brute force web server compromise on `yummyrecipesforme.com`.  
  Analyzed `tcpdump` logs to trace DNS and HTTP traffic, identified protocol usage, and documented a structured security incident report with remediation steps.  
  Repository includes full scenario, raw logs, and Markdown-based incident documentation.  

- **[🔐 Analysis of Network Hardening](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Use-the-NIST-Cybersecurity-Framework-to-respond-to-a-security-incident/tree/main)**  
  Investigated a real-world breach scenario at a social media company. Identified key vulnerabilities such as shared passwords, default admin credentials, and poor firewall rules. Proposed targeted hardening solutions including MFA, firewall rule enforcement, and password policy improvements.  
  Files include a detailed security risk assessment report and a curated table of hardening tools with descriptions and implementation use cases.

# Rehan Ahmad – Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!
I am currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and have completed multiple hands-on projects in areas such as network attack analysis, incident response, system hardening, and SQL-based security investigations. So far, my work includes analyzing real-world inspired scenarios like SYN flood attacks, brute force compromises, and DDoS incidents, as well as configuring secure Linux file permissions and conducting NIST CSF-based security audits. Each project reflects my growing expertise in threat detection, log analysis, and security control implementation—building a strong foundation for my career as a cybersecurity analyst.

## 📂 Projects
- **[🛡️ Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/internal-security-audit-botium-toys)**  
  NIST CSF-based audit for a fictional toy company. Included risk assessment, compliance checklist, and self-assessment.

- **[🚨 SYN Flood Case Study – Network Attack Analysis](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Analyze-network-attacks)**  
  Investigated a SYN flood DoS attack using Wireshark. Differentiated between normal and malicious TCP traffic and wrote a professional incident report.  
  Files include log analysis, report, and interpretation guide.

- **[🔐 Brute Force Attack Case Study – HTTP & DNS Log Analysis](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/security-incident-report-brute-force)**  
  Investigated a brute force web server compromise on `yummyrecipesforme.com`.  
  Analyzed `tcpdump` logs to trace DNS and HTTP traffic, identified protocol usage, and documented a structured security incident report with remediation steps.  
  Repository includes full scenario, raw logs, and Markdown-based incident documentation.  

- **[🔐 Analysis of Network Hardening](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Analysis-of-network-hardening)**  
  Investigated a real-world breach scenario at a social media company. Identified key vulnerabilities such as shared passwords, default admin credentials, and poor firewall rules. Proposed targeted hardening solutions including MFA, firewall rule enforcement, and password policy improvements.  
  Files include a detailed security risk assessment report and a curated table of hardening tools with descriptions and implementation use cases.

- **[🧾 Linux File Permissions Project – Secure File & Directory Access](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Manage-Linux-File-Permissions)**

  Configured secure access settings on a Linux system using CLI commands such as `ls -la` and `chmod`. Applied the principle of least privilege to ensure sensitive files and directories comply with organizational security policies.

  - 🔐 Adjusted permissions on project files and hidden archives  
  - 📁 Secured directory access for confidential data  
  - 🖥️ Used `chmod` to remove group and other write access

  - 📸 [Screenshots Folder in Repo](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Manage-Linux-File-Permissions)
  > Demonstrates practical use of Linux permission management and strengthens security analyst fundamentals.

- **[🧩 Apply Filters to SQL Queries – Cybersecurity Data Investigation](https://github.com/i-am-rehan/Apply-filters-to-SQL-queries/tree/main)**  
  Investigated security-related login activities and employee records using SQL filters and JOINs. Focused on identifying suspicious patterns through queries using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, and `INNER JOIN`.  
  Tasks included:
  - 🔍 After-hours failed login investigation  
  - 🕵️‍♂️ Date-specific suspicious login detection  
  - 🌍 Geolocation-based filtering (e.g., excluding Mexico)  
  - 🏢 Department and office-based filtering for machine updates  
  - 🔗 Employee–login JOINs to correlate identities with activity

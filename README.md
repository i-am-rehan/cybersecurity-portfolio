# Rehan Ahmad – Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!
I am currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and have completed multiple hands-on projects in areas such as network attack analysis, incident response, system hardening, and SQL-based security investigations. So far, my work includes analyzing real-world inspired scenarios like SYN flood attacks, brute force compromises, and DDoS incidents, as well as configuring secure Linux file permissions and conducting NIST CSF-based security audits. Each project reflects my growing expertise in threat detection, log analysis, and security control implementation—building a strong foundation for my career as a cybersecurity analyst.

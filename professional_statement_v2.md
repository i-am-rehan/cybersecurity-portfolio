**Professional Statement**  

I am a dedicated cybersecurity analyst committed to safeguarding systems, networks, and applications from evolving digital threats. I began my career in web development, creating functional and user-friendly websites while prioritizing security from the outset by applying OWASP principles, input validation, data encryption, and access control measures using technologies such as PHP, React, Node.js, WordPress, and Dreamweaver. Expanding into cybersecurity, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, gaining expertise in threat modeling, security hardening, packet capture and analysis (tcpdump/Wireshark), log analysis, and incident handling. I have practical experience in firewall rules configuration, egress/ingress filtering, MFA implementation, and SIEM alert investigation. I bring a proactive security mindset and a strong understanding of NIST CSF and CIA Triad principles to ensure the resilience and trustworthiness of digital environments.
